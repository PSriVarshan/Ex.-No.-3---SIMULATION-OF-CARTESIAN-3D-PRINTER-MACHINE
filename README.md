#### Smooth Rod : 
Smooth rods are used as guide rails in Cartesian 3D printer machines to ensure accurate movement of the printer head along the X axis. They are typically made of hardened steel or stainless steel and need to be kept clean and smooth for optimal performance.

#### Bearing : 
A bearing in a Cartesian 3D printer is a component that reduces friction and provides smooth movement. They support the smooth rods and enable the printer head to move precisely along the X axis.

#### Idler :
An idler in a Cartesian 3D printer is a pulley or wheel that guides and tensions the printer's belts, ensuring the correct tension and direction of movement.

#### Extruder:
The extruder in a Cartesian 3D printer melts and deposits printing material onto the printing bed using a motor, heating element, and nozzle. It's controlled by software to achieve precise printing results.

#### Motor: 
The motor in a 3D Cartesian printer drives the printer head's movement precisely and is controlled by software. It receives signals from the printer's control board and turns a threaded rod or belt.

### Y Axis Assembly

#### Y-Axis Supporter :
The Y-axis supporter in a 3D Cartesian printer holds the smooth rods in place to prevent bending during the printer's operation. It ensures accurate and smooth movement of the printer head along the Y-axis, contributing to printing quality.

#### Horizontal  & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal and vertical threaded rods in a 3D Cartesian printer support and provide movement for the printer head along the X axis. They are threaded and coupled with a motor for smooth movement.

#### Smooth Rod :
Smooth rods are used as guide rails in Cartesian 3D printer machines to ensure accurate movement of the printer head along the  Y axes. They are typically made of hardened steel or stainless steel and need to be kept clean and smooth for optimal performance

#### Pulley :
Pulley is a wheel that connects to the motor and moves the Y-axis using a belt. It enables precise control of the print head or print bed position during 3D printing

#### Motor :
In a Cartesian 3D printer's Y-axis assembly, the motor is the electrical component that drives the movement of the Y-axis. It rotates and works with the pulley and belt system to accurately position the Y-axis gantry for precise 3D printing.

#### Y-Axis Frame :
The Y-axis frame in a Cartesian 3D printer's Y-axis assembly is the sturdy structure that supports and guides the Y-axis components for stable and precise movement during printing. It provides a solid foundation for the motor, pulley system, and Y-axis gantry, ensuring consistent and high-quality prints.

#### Y-Axis Base :

The Y-axis base in a Cartesian 3D printer's Y-axis assembly is the stable foundation on which the Y-axis components are mounted. It ensures precise and controlled movement along the Y-axis for accurate 3D printing.
